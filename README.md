# EarCandle
EarCandle wants to provide users with their virtual machines 

If one uses virtualization servers like proxmox one could provide the users with a limited proxmox web gui but I feel that users do not need to know about proxmox. They log on at some web portal and get some buttons where they could see their machines which the can start, stop or suspend.
Just minimal functionality for a careless user of a VM, that just should work somehow. Dont bother me with details :-)

Interesting approaches that should be considered for integration are:

https://github.com/joshpatten/PVE-VDIClient

For registration and login-foo:
https://github.com/samir321-pixel/Django-Registration
https://github.com/vismodo/django-login-and-register


So EarCandle is sort of a playground for now.
