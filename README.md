# EarCandle
EarCandle wants to provide users with their virtual machines 

If one uses virtualization servers like Proxmox-VE one could provide the users with a limited proxmox web gui but I feel that users do not need to know about proxmox. They log on at some web portal and get some buttons where they could see their machines which they can start, stop or suspend.
Just minimal functionality for a careless user of a VM, that just should work somehow. Don't bother me with details :-)



Interesting approaches that should be considered for integration are:

For registration and login-foo:

Status:
EarCandle is sort of a playground for now.


Hints: Maybe, statically linked oasislinux is a good VM platform for EarCandle
